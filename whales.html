          <h2>Blue Whale: Balaenoptera Musculus</h2>
          <p>Blue whales are thought to be the largest animals ever to have lived on Earth. 
              They reach lengths up to 100 feet and weigh 100 to 150 tons. 
              Their skin is a beautiful gray-blue color, often with a mottling of light spots.</p>

          <h2>Fin Whale: Balaenoptera Physalus</h2>  
          <p>The fin whale is the second-largest animal in the world. 
              Its sleek appearance caused sailors to call it the "greyhound of the sea." 
              Fin whales are a streamlined baleen whale and the only animal known to be asymmetrically colored, 
              as they have a white patch on their lower jaw only on the right side.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "col_1">
          <h2>Sei Whale: Balaenoptera Borealis</h2>
          <p>Sei (pronounced "say") whales are one of the fastest whale species. They are streamlined,
            with a dark back and white underside and very curved dorsal fin. The name came from seje, 
            the Norwegian word for pollock, 
          a type of fish because sei whales and pollock often appeared off Norway's coast at the same time.</p>

          <h3>North Atlantic Right Whale: Eubalaena Glacialis</h3> 
          <p>The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered marine mammals, 
          with only about 400 remaining. It was known as the "right" whale for whalers to hunt because of its slow speed, 
          tendency to float when killed, and thick blubber layer. 
          The callosities on the right whale's head help scientists identify and catalog individuals. 
          Right whales spend their summer feeding season in cold northern latitudes off Canada and 
          New England and their winter breeding season off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia. and Florida.</p>

          <h3>Southern Right Whale: Eubalaena Australis</h3>
          <p>The southern right whale is a large, bulky-looking baleen whale that reaches 45 to 55 feet in length 
          and weighs up to 60 tons. They have the curious habit of "sailing" in strong winds by 
          lifting their huge tail flukes above the water surface.</p>
